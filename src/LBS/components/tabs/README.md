# Tabs

## Installation

See the [main README quick start guide](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend#quick-start) for how to install this component.

## Guidance and Examples

Cards are containers used to organize high-level content. Using cards can make your web product more appealing and navigable.

Use a card to give users a brief summary of content or a task, often with a link to more detail. You can display a card alongside other cards to group related content or tasks.

Find out when to use the tabs component in your service in the [LBS Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/tabs).

## Component options

Use options to customise the appearance, content and behaviour of a component when using a macro, for example, changing the text.

See [options table](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/header/#options-tabs-example) for details.
