# London Borough of Sutton (LBS) Frontend

This repository contains the code you need to start building user interfaces for LBS platforms and services.

The intention of the project is to extend the fantastic [GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend), standardise overrides and add LBS specific components and styles where user research has deemed them necessary.

See live examples of GOV.UK Frontend components, and guidance on when to use
them in your service, in the [GOV.UK Design
System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

Additionally, see live examples of LBS specific Frontend components, and guidance on when to use
them in your service, in the [LBS Design
System (Coming soon)](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

As far as is possible, installation, testing etc. follows the same principles and processes as GOV.UK Frontend and so, as to not replicate the documentation - please refer to [appropriate documentation on the GOV.UK Frontend repository.](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend)
